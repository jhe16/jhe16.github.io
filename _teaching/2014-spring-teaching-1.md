This course explores design and implementation principles in modern distributed systems. In particular, the course will emphasize on recent techniques used by real-world distributed systems such as cloud systems, enterprise data center, and virtualized container systems. Topics include canonical distributed concepts such as remote procedure call, distributed objects, replication, distributed system security, consensus protocol, and recent distributed system technologies such as peer-to-peer, grid, autonomic computing, distributed massive data processing/Google map-reduce, machine learning for distributed systems, distributed system debugging, multi-core systems, distributed virtualization.

Prerequisites
======
CS130 and CS120 or equivalents. Programming in C++ or Java in Unix environment. If you are not sure whether you can attend this course, please consult the instructor.

Tentative Grading Policy
======
Quiz and class participation: 15%, paper presentation: 15%, written reviews: 20%, project 60% (proposal writeup 5%, proposal presentation 5%, project midreview presentation 10%, demo 10%, final presentation 10%, final writeup 10%)

Late Policy
======
Calculated by the time recorded in the assignment emails received to the instructor. Students will lose 20% for each 24-hour period they are late on reviews, project, or paper.

Textbooks
======
1. Distributed systems principles and paradigms, Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten van Steen, ISBN：0-13-239227-5, Pearson, 2007.
2. Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design, George Coulouris, Jean Dollimore, Tim Kindberg, and Gordon Blair, ISBN：978-0132143011, Pearson, 2011.

Paper Review Guidelines
======
Provide a paragraph of summary about the paper, a paragraph of 2-3 strong points of the paper (i.e., Why the paper should be accepted), a paragraph of 2-3 weak points of the paper (i.e., why the paper should be rejected),  brainstorming ideas for developing new research ideas related to the work described in the paper.

Projects
======
Suggested topics:
1. Virtual Machine Management in Distributed Computing Environments
2. System Monitoring & Behavior Learning for Anomaly Detection
3. Distributed system diagnosis using console logs or traces

Both project proposal and final report should follow typical paper requirements using ACM Double-Column Paper format. The project proposal should include abstract, introduction, proposed approaches, and related work. The final project report should include a full paper content including abstract, introduction, design and algorithms, experiment evaluation, related work, and conclusion. We will organize a mini-conference for the students to present their project work. Three best papers will be selected during the mini-conference.
