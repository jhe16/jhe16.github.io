I received my PhD degree from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu) of the [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu) in 2021, advised by [Prof. Xiaohui (Helen) Gu](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/gu/). Before that, I obtained my MPhil degree from [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/eng/main/index.jsp) in 2016. I received my BS degree from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) in 2013. 

My research interest lies in improving reliability, availability, and performance of large-scale cloud systems. Currently, I am conducting researches on developing automatic bug detection, diagnosis, and fixing tools for cloud systems.
