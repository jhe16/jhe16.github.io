I am Jingzhu He, a final year PhD student at [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu) of [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu). I am a member of [DANCE research group](http://dance.csc.ncsu.edu), working with [Dr. Xiaohui (Helen) Gu](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/gu/). 

I have a broad interest in distributed system, cloud computing and big data analytics. Currently, I am conducting researches on developing automatic bug detection, diagnosis and fixing tools for distributed systems. 

Prior to coming to NCSU, I obtained my Bachelor degree from [School of Electronic and Science Engineering](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/ese_en/main.htm) of [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp) in June 2013. I obtained M.Phil degree from [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/eng/main/index.jsp) in June 2016.
